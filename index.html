    <h1>Hello ASIC GUI</h1>
    <p>ASIC testing is stressful as it canâ€™t go wrong. I am determined to ease HW Engineer's pain with 
       this GUI by connecting the complex ASIC's internal registers to an interactive webpage. Now, they can change the registers, record
       their tests and all steps automatically stored in a Database. Also, my first CSS, HTML and JavaScript skill test :).
